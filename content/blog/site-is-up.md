_(Not official yet)_
We are very happy to announce that Py4AI Website is finally publicly available.
You are now able to consult the basic information about the conference.

In the next weeks we will keep updating
the site. In particular we will make available tickets
to reserve a spot, we will add information about speakers and the program and we will give more information about the logistics.

If you want to check out the site source it is available at https://github.com/pietroppeter/py4ai

The template for this site has been adapted
from [PyData Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pydata.org/).
We want to thank Matthis Brouns for support in setting this up.
